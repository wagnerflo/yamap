# How – yamap – YAML to Python!

yamap is the bastard child of a YAML to Python data mapper and a schema
definition DSL and validator. It tries to

- make loading YAML files easy
- while also giving you the option to build a tree of custom objects
- and at the same time verify that your files adhere to a structure
- defined using a simple tree of type-objects.

For details see the [documentation](https://yamap.readthedocs.io).
